# NOTE
After writing your program, ensure to put "io.read()" on the final line so that the command prompt process can keep running until you press a key.
ZLE is nowhere near finished and will have many more useful add-ons and features soon. Light Mode is unfinished but still usable, sorry for the inconvenience to any light mode users!
Expect future updates such as error and warning highlights, more themes, and the elimination of the requirement to put "io.read()" at the end of the script/program.

Thanks for using ZLE
